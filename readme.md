# Learning Typescript

This repo contains differnt projects that I implemented while learning to use Typescript.

I had started my journey on **Monday, ‎March ‎1, ‎2021, ‏‎5:53:03 PM.**

Today, after **16 days** of daily commits, I finally have learned the basics and some of the advanced features of the language.

That however does **not** mean, I have **mastered** TS. More is **yet** to be discovered.

More is yet to be learned.

I want to conclude by saying that from now on I will be trying my best to use TS's features to best of their abilities, wherever possible.
